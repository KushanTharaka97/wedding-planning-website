## Notes

Build a wedding planning web site from JSP/Servlets.
Wedding Planning Site was a winning idea, I won the entrepreneur club competition because of this web site, however, the web site is developed with JSP/Servlet based environment. The external database is MySQL database because of some JavaScript we can't recommend as production-ready but this is a fully functional web site for using. I have categorized three user groups as admin, service providers, and normal legitimate users. Service providers can make their advertisements on our website, publish it, make their details, and so on.
Then normal users can select the services that they are looking for at their wedding.
